# Pre Requisite for running the Framework 

******(Machine Used - Mac)*******

1. Java installed  (JDK 14)

2. Maven Installed (V - 3.6.3) 

3. git installed (V-2.23.0)

4. open Terminal and enter command - git clone https://github.com/aaditya5490/QA-Assignment.git

5. Folder with name "QA-Assignmen" will be created 

6. change directory to "QA-Assignmen"

7. verify file contents (pom.xml ,src) 

8. provide command based on execution type 

  8.1  Smoke tests -> mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=chrome -Denv=preprod -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@Smoke_tests
  
  8.2 Functional tests -> mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=chrome -Denv=preprod -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@Functional_tests
  
  8.3 Non Functional tests ->  mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=chrome -Denv=preprod -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@Non_Functional_tests
  
9. Once Execution is over navigate to target folder for viewing output of executon 

  9.1 Html Report -> Open target/cucumber-advanced-reports/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html created under Project Directory (if there a failure will be screenshot is taken placed in target/cucumber-advanced-reports/creenshots and embedded to html file mentioned earlier 
  
  9.2 Log -> Log will be created under target folder with Time Stamp of execution
